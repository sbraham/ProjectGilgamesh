# ProjectGilgamesh
The project is a pesonal project I am attempting in my free time. The aim is to create the Royal Game of Ur (Game of 20 Square) in code and then attempt to develop and optomise a number of AIs that are capable of playing the game well.

A write up of the porject can be found at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b853IG8McpPnswgVL88rs1z0igc1P0tiQFxjRv27MUs/edit?usp=sharing

The file Game_of_Ur-v1.py contains the initial version of the game - although notobly lacks any end game handling or menu
This was developed with the aim of finding out how the game will run and gain some intuitian about the program

The file Game_of_Ur-v2.py contains the second version of the game (WORK IN PROGRESS) - built better and runs better with a compleat menu and end of game handling
This version of the game allows for a fully functional game with human input or random input as will as a auto play feature to instantly run X number of games (only with random inputs) - this version does not yet have AI functionality

The direcotry Game_of_Ur-v3.py contains the python files that are used to run the 3rd version of this project (WORK IN PROGRESS)
