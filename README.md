# ProjectGilgamesh
The project is a pesonal project I am attempting in my free time. The aim is to create the Royal Game of Ur (Game of 20 Square) in code and then attempt to develop and optomise a number of AIs that are capable of playing the game well.

A write up of the porject can be found at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b853IG8McpPnswgVL88rs1z0igc1P0tiQFxjRv27MUs/edit?usp=sharing

The file Game_of_Ur-v1.py contains the initial version of the game - although notobly lacks any end game handling or menu
This was developed with the aim of finding out how the game will run and gain some intuitian about the program

The file Game_of_Ur-v2.py contains the second version of the game (WORK IN PROGRESS) - built better and runs better with a compleat menu and end of game handling
This version of the game is what the AIs will work with
